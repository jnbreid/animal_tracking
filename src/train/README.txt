abstract = {Biodiversity crisis has continued to accelerate. Studying animal distribution, movement and behaviour is of critical importance to address environmental challenges such as spreading of diseases, invasive species, climate and land-use change. Camera traps are an appropriate technique for continuous animal monitoring in an automated 24/7/52 documentation. This study shows a proof-of-concept for an end-to-end pipeline to detect and classify animals and their behaviour in video clips. Video clips are captured with 8 frames per second by camera traps using infrared cameras and infrared flash-lights. The clips show deer, boars, foxes and hares - mostly at night time. Our approach shows an average precision of 63.8% for animal detection and identification. For action recognition the achieved accuracies range between 88.4% and 94.1%.}
