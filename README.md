# Animal Tracker

## Overview
This project provides a pipeline for tracking and segmenting animals in video footage. It leverages pretrained models and foundation models to detect

facilitating the analysis of expecially camera trap videos.



- running inference with the whole pipeline on a gpu needs 10-11 gb of vram





Example videos obtained by applying the tracking pipeline to the videos:
